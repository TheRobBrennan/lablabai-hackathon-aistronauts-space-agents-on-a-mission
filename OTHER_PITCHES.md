## AI-Powered Drone Delivery System
[AI-Powered Drone Delivery System](https://lablab.ai/event/aistronauts-space-agents-on-a-mission/astroautomators/ai-powered-drone-delivery-system)

The AI-powered Drone Delivery System hackathon aims to revolutionize the logistics industry by integrating cutting-edge AI and automation into the delivery process. we design and develop an AI-driven platform that enables drone deliveries by calculating optimal routes using the GraphHopper API and providing real-time tracking updates through interactive maps powered by Folium. The system will automatically update users with delivery progress, including notifications sent via email using SMTP. By leveraging geolocation services like Geopy and mapping APIs, this hackathon challenges us to build a fully functional drone delivery system that can simulate drone movements and notify users about their order status at each stage, from order placement to successful delivery. This competition encourages us in innovation in both logistics and AI, pushing the boundaries of smart city infrastructure and autonomous systems.
