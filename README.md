Given that I am starting the project midway through the hackathon - roughly at **5:30 PM PST** on **Saturday, February 8th, 2025** - I will be curious to see what I wind up doing or creating. üòÖ

# Satellite Imagery Analysis Platform

## Project Structure
```
apps/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ nextjs-web/     # Frontend application
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ python-api/     # Backend API service
```

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites
- Docker and Docker Compose
- Node.js 18+ (for local development)
- Python 3.11+ (for local development)
- API keys for:
  - Mapbox (for map visualization)
  - NASA Earth Data
  - OpenAI (for AI analysis)
  - Sentinel Hub (optional)

### Environment Setup

1. **Frontend Setup (nextjs-web)**
   ```bash
   cd apps/nextjs-web
   cp .env.example .env
   ```
   Add your Mapbox token to `.env`:
   ```
   NEXT_PUBLIC_MAPBOX_ACCESS_TOKEN=your_token_here
   ```

2. **Backend Setup (python-api)**
   ```bash
   cd apps/python-api
   cp .env.example .env
   ```
   Add your API keys to `.env`:
   ```
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_key_here
   NASA_API_KEY=your_nasa_key_here
   SENTINEL_HUB_API_KEY=your_sentinel_hub_key_here
   ```

### Running with Docker

1. **Start all services**
   ```bash
   docker-compose up --build
   ```
   This will start:
   - Frontend at http://localhost:3000
   - Backend API at http://localhost:8000

2. **View API documentation**
   - OpenAPI docs: http://localhost:8000/docs
   - ReDoc: http://localhost:8000/redoc

### Local Development

1. **Frontend (Next.js)**
   ```bash
   cd apps/nextjs-web
   npm install
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Backend (FastAPI)**
   ```bash
   cd apps/python-api
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # or `venv\Scripts\activate` on Windows
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   uvicorn src.main:app --reload
   ```

## API Services

The Python API provides:
- Satellite imagery fetching
- AI-powered analysis
- Change detection
- Report generation

## Available Endpoints

- `GET /health` - Health check endpoint
- `GET /api/v1/...` - API endpoints (documentation in progress)

## Development Workflow

1. Frontend changes:
   - Edit files in `apps/nextjs-web/src`
   - Changes hot-reload in development

2. Backend changes:
   - Edit files in `apps/python-api/src`
   - FastAPI auto-reloads on changes

## Troubleshooting

Common issues:
1. **Port conflicts**: Ensure ports 3000 and 8000 are available
2. **Environment variables**: Verify all required API keys are set
3. **Docker issues**: Try removing containers and rebuilding:
   ```bash
   docker-compose down
   docker-compose up --build
   ```

## Next Steps

- [ ] Implement satellite imagery fetching
- [ ] Add AI analysis capabilities
- [ ] Create map overlays
- [ ] Generate analysis reports
