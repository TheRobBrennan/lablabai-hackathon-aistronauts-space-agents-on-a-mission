# Welcome
This is my project for a potential LabLab AI Hackathon submission for the [AIstronauts: Space Agents on a mission](https://lablab.ai/event/aistronauts-space-agents-on-a-mission) hackathon - held from **Friday, February 7th 2025 - 9:00 AM PST** to **Sunday, February 9th 2025 - 9:00 AM PST**.

Given that I am starting the project midway through the hackathon - roughly at **5:30 PM PST** on **Saturday, February 8th, 2025** - I will be curious to see what I wind up doing or creating. üòÖ

### Suggested Topics to Explore

#### Automation of Space Operations

üõ∞Ô∏è Problem Statement: Space missions require managing complex operations, often relying on repetitive and time-intensive tasks.

Challenge: Develop AI agents to automate mission planning, resource allocation, and communication systems, enhancing efficiency and reducing human workload.


#### Reducing Operational Inefficiencies

üöÄ Problem Statement: Space agencies face challenges in optimizing resource use and minimizing waste during missions.

Challenge: Design AI agents that detect inefficiencies, optimize fuel consumption, and streamline supply chain logistics for space missions.

#### Enhancing Citizen Access to Space Data

üåå Problem Statement: Access to space-related data and insights can be challenging for researchers, educators, and the general public.

Challenge: Build AI agents that simplify access to space data, enable educational tools, and foster citizen engagement in space exploration.
