# Welcome
This is my project for a potential LabLab AI Hackathon submission for the [AIstronauts: Space Agents on a mission](https://lablab.ai/event/aistronauts-space-agents-on-a-mission) hackathon - held from **Friday, February 7th 2025 - 9:00 AM PST** to **Sunday, February 9th 2025 - 9:00 AM PST**.

Given that I am starting the project midway through the hackathon - roughly at **5:30 PM PST** on **Saturday, February 8th, 2025** - I will be curious to see what I wind up doing or creating. 😅

> 78% of people “fail” at hackathons 😅

> By processing data, understanding context, and executing actions, AI Agents enhance efficiency, reduce errors, and provide intelligent solutions to complex challenges.

> Their ability to operate continuously and make informed decisions based on real-time data makes them invaluable in modern technology landscapes.

## Ground control

Checklist of necessary steps to complete the mission:

- Create or join a team on LabLab.ai
- BRAINSTORM: 2-3 concepts for an AI agent solution that transforms space exploration
    - After generating a list of potential solutions, the team should evaluate each idea based on factors such as feasibility, scalability, profitability, and market potential.
    - Evaluate the feasibility of each idea: in terms of available AI models, required data, technical expertise, and potential impact.
    - Resource Allocation: Consider the resources (timeline of hackathon, developers, availability of API Keys) needed to implement each idea. Choose ideas that align with available resources.
- BUILD: Build a prototype for your solution
- SUBMIT: Submit your solution to the hackathon per the [Submission Guidelines](https://lablab.ai/delivering-your-hackathon-solution)
    - Product Description
    - Presentation (not to exceed 5 minutes)
    - GitHub link with the demo
